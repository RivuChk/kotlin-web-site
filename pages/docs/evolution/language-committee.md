# About the Kotlin Language Committee 

As part of the efforts to move Kotlin into a non-profit entity, the Kotlin
Language Committee was created to oversee changes to the Kotlin
language.

This committee is in charge of ensuring the Kotlin language ages well
over time; to ensure that any work done in new versions of the language
does not put an undue burden on users trying to migrate from older
versions to the newer version.

The committee achieves this goal by maintaining this deprecation policy
and reviewing proposed changes to the language and determining what
parts of the deprecation procedures apply.

Current members of this committee:

*   [William Cook, University of Texas at Austin](https://github.com/w7cook)
*   [Andrey Breslav, JetBrains](https://github.com/abreslav)
*   [Jeffrey van Gogh, Google](https://github.com/jvgogh)
