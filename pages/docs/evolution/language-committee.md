# Kotlin Language Evolution 

Evolving a language in a consistent and healthy way is challenging due to a number of trade-offs, biggest of which are adding useful features vs keeping the complexity down and fixing past mistakes vs maintaining compatibility. In both cases, the balance is not immediately obvious. Growing a language must be done very cautiously to avoid both "feature creep" and stagnation. It's easy to start as a modern language, but legacy can easily accumulate over years of thoroughly preserving backward compatibility. Kotlin aims at the sweet spot of evolving continuously and pragmatically.    

This document outlines the governance model of language evolution for Kotlin.

## Lead Language Designer 

In Kotlin, the job of finding the right balance in these trade-offs and directing the language evolution belongs to the Lead Language Designer (currently Andrey Breslav).  

## About the Kotlin Language Committee

While additions to the language are ultimately at the Lead Designer's sole discretion, changes that might affect compatibility are performed with even more consideration. 

As part of the efforts to move Kotlin into a non-profit entity, the Kotlin Language Committee was created to oversee changes to the Kotlin
language.
 
This committee is in charge of ensuring the Kotlin language ages well
over time; to ensure that any work done in new versions of the language
does not put an undue burden on users trying to migrate from older
versions to the newer version.

The committee achieves this goal by maintaining this deprecation policy
and reviewing proposed changes to the language and determining what
parts of the deprecation procedures apply.

Current members of this committee:

*   [William Cook, University of Texas at Austin](https://github.com/w7cook)
*   [Andrey Breslav, JetBrains](https://github.com/abreslav)
*   [Jeffrey van Gogh, Google](https://github.com/jvgogh)
